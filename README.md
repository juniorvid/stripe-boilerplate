# Well then. This is awkward.
## I was going to make something cool. But wifi here sucks.
I was almost done with the project, connecting my database, when I found an error. Now normally this would have worked perfectly... but we were at a school. The wifi blocked any connections they deemed unnecessary for school function. And I couldn't connect my database. The main part of my project. I did as much as I could but this project will remain, unfortunately, unfinished until a further period.
